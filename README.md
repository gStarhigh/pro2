## Wireframes (Balsamiq)
I created the wireframes for this site with Balsamiq. All wireframes can be found in the folder called [Wireframes](https://github.com/gStarhigh/pro2/tree/main/assets/wireframes).
The wireframes should not be considered finished product, but as a tool I used as inspiration when creating the Quiz.
