# HTML & CSS Project for Code Institute

## General information
---

This is a Quiz about Harry Potter by J.K Rowling. This is a project for a course in JavaScript, Project Portfolio 2, for Code Institute by Gustaf Starh√∂g.

The purpose of this website is to promote myself and my skills in Html, CSS & JavaScript. The website is a quiz about Harry Potter with 3 different difficulties to choose from.

The entire game is built upon 1 HTML file, where the sections within this file are shown whether or not they have the class of "hide". This is decided through JavaScript with eventlisteners depending on what the user click on. 
When the site is loaded, the class of "hide" is removed from the "welcome-game-area" and added to all other sections of the page.

## Wireframes (Balsamiq)
I created the wireframes for this site with Balsamiq. All wireframes can be found in the folder called [Wireframes](https://github.com/gStarhigh/pro2/tree/main/assets/wireframes).
The wireframes should not be considered finished product, but as a tool I used as inspiration when creating the Quiz.

## General features
- The website was created with the idea of making a Harry Potter game that the user could interact with and choose different ways to play in form of difficulty levels and using their own username. 
- The game provides 10 questions for each difficulty level that are displayed depending on what difficulty the user chooses. 
- The game keeps track of the users correct answers and displays them when the user has answered all 10 questions.
- There is a timer displayed when the user has started to play that counts down from 15seconds. If the user fails to click an answer before the timer runs out, the buttons disables and the correct answer is displayed. The user can no longer choose an answer.
- If a user clicks an answer before the timer has run out, the timer is stopped and, if the user answered correctly, the score is increased in the bottom right. 
- When either the user has chosen an answer, or the time has run out, the next question button "arrow" will appear that will load the next question for the user when clicked, removes the disabled attribute on the buttons and lets the user answer the next question. The countdown is also reset.
- The website is responsive on all devices.

### Home Section
- When you enter the site you are greeted with the home page. At the top left corner, of all pages, is a Home icon, that takes you back to the home section from anywhere in the game. 
- The username input is focused so the user can input their username on a computer without having to click the input first. 
- If the user fails to enter a username and tries to click the button to start the game, a error message will appear telling the user that a username is mandatory to proceed.
- When the user have entered a username and clicks the "Alohomora" button, the game proceeds to show the rules of the game. Alohomora is the spell in Harry Potter that is used to unlock doors.
- Logic:
    - When the site is loaded, a class of "hide" is added to the difficulty/questions/finished & rules sections and removes it from the welcome section. The class of hide is targeted in the style.css file and adds a display of none to the sections that has the class. 
    - When the user clicks the "Alohomora" button, an eventlistener in the script.js file removes the "hide" class from the rules section, and adds it to the welcome section, thus displaying the rules section of the index.html file.

### Rules Section
- Before the user can start to play, the rules are shown for the user. It explains that:
    - The user has a 15 second timer to answer each question. 
    - There is only 1 correct answer.
    - Depending on what score you get,you can acchieve 4 different status levels ranked from high to low: Headmaster, N.E.W.T, 3rd year & first year. 
- After the user has read through the rules and the information about the levels, the user clicks the "Choose difficulty" button that takes the user further in the game process.
- Logic:
    - When the user clicks the "Choose difficulty" button, an eventlistener in the script.js file removes the "hide" class from the difficulty section, and adds it to the rules section, thus displaying the question section of the index.html file. 
<details>

</details>

### Difficulty Section
- When the user arrives to the difficulty section the user are greeted with a headline that explains that "you are about to embark into the Harry Potter World" and that you should choose your difficulty wisely.
- You have 3 different difficulties to choose from: Easy, Medium or Hard. 
- Depending on what the user chooses, different questions will be loaded to match the difficulty.
- Logic:
    - When the user clicks the any of the difficulty buttons (Easy, Medium or Hard), an eventlistener in the script.js file listens for which button was pressed, and runs the game with the questions corresponding to what difficulty the user chose.
    - When a difficulty button has been pressed, the hide class gets added to the difficulty section and removes it from the questions section thus displaying the questions.

</details>

### Game Section
- Now the user has arrived at the game. Depending on the difficulty level the user has chosen, different questions will load into the game. 
- Game discription:
    - At the top of the game the question is displayed.
    - Below the question there is 4 different answers that the user can choose from. There is only 1 correct answer. 
    - At the bottom left of the game, there is an hourglass icon and next to it the time left is displayed. If the timer reaches 5seconds, the color of the time becomes red to indicate that the time is about to run out. 
    - At the bottom right there is a score tracker. Whenever a user clicks the correct answer, it increases by 1. There is 10 questions, so the max score is 10 that the user can get. 
    - The questions are shown randomly and does not show in the same order if you replay the game.
    - When the user has answered all questions, or if the time has run out on all questions, the game is over and the game will show the finished section.
- Logic:
    - When all 10 questions of the quiz have been asked to the user, the hide class gets added to the questions section and removes it from the finished section thus displaying the finished sections information.

<summary>Screenshot of Questions page</summary>

</details>

### Finished Section
- When the user arrives to the finished section, the game is over and the user has gone through all 10 questions in the chosen difficulty. 
- There is a congratulatory message that explains that the user has finished the game.
- Depending on the score that the user got, different messages are displayed, along with the username that the user chose in the beginning of the game. 
- Below that is the score shown for the user,"You got "x" out of 10 correct answers".
- Below that is a question that asks the user if they want to play again.
- At the bottom of the page is a button that says "Play again". If the user presses this button, the difficulty section is shown again. When you play again, if you press the play again button, you dont want to enter the username one more time. This is why I chose to not go back to the start, the user has already a username, the user has read the rules but what the user might want to change is the difficulty. This is why the play again button takes you back to the difficulty section.

- Logic
    - When the game is over, the user has an option to play again. An eventlistener listens for the user to click the playagain button. If the user does so, it adds the hide class to the finished section, and removes it from the difficulty section, so that the user can, if they want, choose a different difficulty.
    The score and the amount of questions asked, are set to 0. The user still has the same username and is not required to enter that again.

## Code validation
- All code on the site has been validated, HTML,CSS & JavaScript, by use of the W3C validator and Jshint. 
### HTML
- W3C - HTML validator: (https://validator.w3.org/)
    - W3C Validator for HTML shows no errors on the index.html file.
    - The W3C validator for HTML shows 3 warnings. These warnings are due to empty headlines in the HTML file. Line, 113,148,149. These headlines are empty because they are targetet with JavaScript to display information depending on the game and the users interaction and therefore have no static headline.
        - Line 113: Targets by its ID, "question-text" in the script.js file to present the user with a question that the user shall answer in the game.
        - Line 148: Targets by its ID, "status-level" in the script.js file to present the user with the username the user entered when starting the game, with a custom response depending on what score the user got.
        - Line 149: Targets by its ID, "finished-score-text" in the script.js file to present the user with the amount of correct answers they got out of the total amount of questions that were presented.
